## Read this first

The Infinite Brain is not only a clean knowledge graph. Its intended business purpose is to
let companies build AI-first shadow departments with a thin layer of humans on top. The
department is the real unit of ROI. A smarter person with a better toolbar is not enough.

## 1. True AI ROI comes from whole-function redesign, not isolated tool gains

Individual productivity gains are real, but they do not automatically become company ROI.
The history pattern is the same as the computer-in-the-corner era: one step improves, but
the whole workflow still bottlenecks in old approvals, inboxes, meetings, and handoffs.

The real gain appears when a whole function is rebuilt so AI does the first pass across the
chain. Then volume, quality, labor cost, or reinvested capacity can move at the company
level.

## 2. The department is the operating assembly over the ontology

A department is not a new low-level primitive like `skill` or `workflow`. It is an
operating assembly over the existing ontology:

- intake surfaces
- knowledge namespaces
- skills
- agents
- workflows
- tools
- metrics
- projects
- human review gates

The department should also make materially related repos explicit when the work spans more than
one repo. Repos are not a department primitive, but they are often a real operating boundary.

The department makes those pieces legible as one business function.

## 3. Intake must hit AI first

If work enters human inboxes and human heads before it enters the architecture, the system is
still human-first. A true AI department begins with intake. Communication, tickets, ideas,
research, meetings, external signals, and internal requests must flow through intake so AI
can triage, route, and act before a human becomes the bottleneck.

## 4. Each department should have a head-of-department agent

One head-of-department agent should own the department's first pass, routing, escalations,
and daily update. It may delegate heavily to specialist agents and workflows, but it owns
coherence. This gives each department an explicit orchestration surface rather than an
unowned pile of components.

## 5. Humans stay on top as a thin layer

The point is not "no humans." The point is that humans move upward in the stack. They own:

- goals and constraints
- high-stakes approvals
- exception handling
- political and organizational judgment
- deep work the current department cannot absorb

The first pass, however, belongs to the AI department.

## 6. Departments should produce daily updates and roll up

Each department should produce its own daily update, because a department that cannot explain
what it saw, did, escalated, and learned is not really operable. Those department updates
should then roll up into a wider daily brief. This makes the architecture visible at the
operating level, not only in file trees.

## 7. Shared platform capabilities should usually be their own department

Not every department should invent its own GitHub, CI/CD, deployment, secret-management, and
observability stack. Those are usually cross-cutting platform functions and should live in a
shared platform department. Domain departments can then own their local adaptations and
domain-specific workflows on top of that substrate.

## 8. Every real department should have a charter

A department should not only be an assembly map. It should also carry a charter: mission,
north star, owned outcomes, KPI set, constraints, related entities, and reporting cadence.

The index tells you what the department is made of. The charter tells you what the
department is trying to improve and how to judge whether it is working.

## 9. Cross-repo ownership should be explicit

As the brain expands, many departments will depend on repos outside
`infinite-brain-os`. Those repos should be tracked in a root repo registry and linked
from the department index. That keeps repo ownership, digestion posture, and migration inputs
visible instead of buried in chat history.

A department stays a folder inside the company brain by default and graduates to its own
repo only when a real access or trust boundary requires it, not on a schedule or for
symmetry with other departments. See [[department-graduates-to-repo-on-trust-boundary]] for
the trigger and [[reflexive-brain-topology]] for how the individual, department, and company
brain tiers compose across the repo root.

## 10. The department is a living web, not a static assembly

This doc describes what a department is made of. A department also has motion: it captures raw
knowledge, converts it to either structured knowledge or built capability (SOPs, deterministic
automations, agent architecture), operates that capability, and feeds what it learns back into
capture. The assembly is the snapshot; the web is the loop that builds and maintains it. Because
the web shape is named, any agent in any session watches conversation for capture candidates and
documents them. See `[[department-web]]` for the full model and
`[[rule-department-web-capture]]` for the ambient-capture contract.

## 11. The department owns its slice of the operating ledger

A department is the owner and accountability unit for its slice of the brain's operating loop. Read as
OODA, the department is an Orient context: its charter and knowledge are the frame it reasons from, and
it runs orient-decide-act on the observations routed to it. In the data model, `observation` carries an
`owning_department_id` that `disposition` and `wager` inherit, so a department filters the whole board
(`item_lifecycle`, `component_health`, `calibration`) by its id to see what is theirs, and learns which
of its own playbooks and skills drive profit. One inbound item that matters to several departments is
split into one observation per department (the fan-out is the split, not a shared row). The department
daily and weekly rollup is exactly this slice aggregated. The full operating guide is
[[department-operating-guide]]; the operative contract is `_system/wager-ledger-rules.md`.

## Changelog

- 2026-05-31: initial canon for the AI shadow department model and the computer-in-the-corner thesis.
- 2026-06-19: added section 11 (the department owns its slice of the operating ledger), pointing to the
  department operating guide and the wager-ledger contract (canonization session).
- 2026-05-31: added explicit repo-registry posture for cross-repo department ownership.
- 2026-06-15: added section 10 linking the department-web model (capture-to-build loop and ambient capture).
- 2026-07-13: extended section 9 with the department repo-graduation trigger (trust boundary,
  not schedule or symmetry), pointing to `[[department-graduates-to-repo-on-trust-boundary]]`
  and `[[reflexive-brain-topology]]`.
