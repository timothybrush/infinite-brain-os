# Agent Load Order: ai-architecture

This file is the load-order controller for the `ai-architecture` namespace. It tells a
retrieving agent what to read first and in what order, by query class. It is navigational:
it carries no knowledge-node frontmatter and is exempt from node-frontmatter checks in
`validate.sh`.

The retrieval consumer this is written for is a Claude Code or Codex file-reading agent
that retrieves by grep and read against the working tree. Load only what the query needs.
The right small set of nodes beats loading the whole namespace.

## The rule

Session startup is governed by [[doctrine-card]], the compressed projection of
core-doctrine that every non-trivial session reads first per the root CLAUDE.md and
AGENTS.md. The card routes; this file sequences the deeper canon read once the question
is an architecture question.

For any architecture question, load in this order:

1. [[core-doctrine]] first, always. It is the compressed first-principles synthesis. Read
   it whole before expanding. It will tell you which deeper node the question needs.
2. The relevant pillar, concept, or decision for the specific question, chosen from the
   query-class table below.
3. The playbook or synthesis node only when the question is about a procedure or a live
   dispute.
4. `support/` only when the question is about provenance, migration, or how a file moved.

Stop loading once the question is answered. Do not pull the whole graph.

## Ordered default load

If you do not yet know the query class, load this default set and let it route you:

1. [[doctrine-card]] if it has not already been read at session startup
2. [[core-doctrine]] (canon keystone)
3. The namespace `INDEX.md` (the retrieval router and query-class map)
4. [[infinite-brain-control-model]] (the foundational pillar)

From there the `INDEX.md` query classes and the table below point you to the rest.

## Orientation reads

When the question is "what is the whole system" or "how do I turn a problem into the brain,"
load the orientation canon before the deeper graph:

- **System overview**: load [[system-overview]] after [[core-doctrine]]. It is the single
  map of every entity type and the four orienting disciplines (INDEX-and-canon-first load
  order, the `_system`-versus-doctrine split, the surface boundary, the planning ladder).
- **Department model**: load [[department-model]] after [[core-doctrine]] when the question
  is about AI shadow departments, department heads, thin human layers, department rollups,
  or the split between intake-operations and infinite-brain-ops.
- **Problem to architecture**: load [[problem-to-architecture]] (and [[system-overview]])
  when converting an unstructured problem or business workflow into an implementable
  AI-architecture-shaped system. It is the operator procedure.

| Metric design: how do numbers stay coherent across namespaces | [[metric-primitive]] |
| Public export: what faces outward and how | [[internal-index-vs-public-llm-index]], [[public-llm-index-export-posture]] |

| Repo topology: when does a department or the individual layer deserve its own repo, how do individual, department, and company brain tiers compose for a company running the standard, and how does a brain repo differ from an app repo | [[reflexive-brain-topology]], [[department-graduates-to-repo-on-trust-boundary]], [[graduate-a-department-to-its-own-brain-repo]], `_system/repo-registry-rules.md` |
| Multi-brain parent workspace: how one person works across several brains, a `.claude/` router over a `brains/` folder, the `/start` bootstrap, the governed `/sync` with proposal-branch routing, the runtime copy-up, and the brain-selection index | [[stand-up-a-multi-brain-parent-workspace]], [[reflexive-brain-topology]], `_system/multi-brain-workspace-contract.md` |

## Notes

- When a question spans classes, load [[core-doctrine]] plus the two or three nodes from
  each relevant row, not every node listed.
- Live disputes route to `synthesis/` (see the `INDEX.md` "Open disputes" section), not
  to canon.
- Provenance and migration questions route to `support/`, not to the doctrine nodes.
- If the query is about a tool API contract, a data pipeline, a design system, a content
  angle, or a recurring operating procedure, this namespace is not the home. It holds the
  architecture doctrine for how those namespaces are built. Route to the relevant profile
  namespace or its `_examples` scaffold.
