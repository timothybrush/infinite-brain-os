# ai-architecture

This namespace holds the doctrine for how the Infinite Brain is built: its control model,
its knowledge-graph topology, its canon and synthesis layers, its retrieval model, the
eight namespace profiles, the intake fabric, the session ledger layer, the AI shadow
department model, the root tools registry, the root secrets registry, the root repo registry,
and the rules that keep
the graph trustworthy as it scales. It also holds the small imported operating layer the
recent management-system review justified: scorecard plus cadence, flow control, fleet
autonomy governance, and accountability plus cost pacing. It is the architecture-of-the-architecture. An agent answering any question
about how the brain itself works, how to build or upgrade a namespace, how to log and close
out AI sessions, or how to design an AI-first department loads here first. This is a
retrieval router, not a folder list. Read [[doctrine-card]] at session startup; read
[[core-doctrine]] whole before expanding into any specific node for architecture work.

## Profile

Doctrine. This namespace carries durable concepts, principles, and decisions about the
architecture itself, so it uses the Doctrine profile (base plus `pillars/`, `concepts/`,
`decisions/`, optional `archive/`). It is the reference implementation of the full V2
base: `INDEX.md`, `canon/`, `playbooks/`, `support/`, `synthesis/`. Canon posture is
full; freshness posture is review-on-edit; it carries no `archive/`.

## Load first

Canon entry points, in order:

1. [[doctrine-card]]: the compressed startup projection of core-doctrine. Every
   non-trivial session reads this first; the root CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md startup
   mandates it. It carries the hard rules and the drill-down pointers.
2. [[core-doctrine]]: the compressed first-principles synthesis. Read this whole before
   any architecture-touching, contract-touching, or canon-touching work. It routes you to
   the deeper node, and it wins over the card on any conflict.
3. [[system-overview]]: the single read-this-first map of the whole brain, the entity types,
   and how the system is oriented and navigated.
4. [[problem-to-architecture]]: the operator procedure for turning an unstructured problem
   or business workflow into an implementable AI-architecture-shaped system.
5. [[department-model]]: the compressed doctrine for AI shadow departments and the thin
   human layer.
6. [[agent-load-order]]: the load-order controller. Tells you what to read next by query
   class.
7. [[canon/README]]: what canon means in this namespace and how it is updated.

Top files after canon:

- [[infinite-brain-control-model]]: the foundational pillar. Where truth lives and what
  owns runtime state.
- [[ai-shadow-departments]]: why company-level ROI comes from department-sized AI-first
  redesign, not isolated tool gains.
- `autonomy-architecture-gap-register`: the highest-signal map of what is still missing
  around fleet safety, identity, accountability, and lifecycle.
- [[retrieval-over-raw-memory]]: why retrieval, not memory, is the operating layer, and
  who the consumer is.
- [[profile-aware-knowledge-graph-design]]: one ontology, eight profiles, shared base.
- [[knowledge-graph-namespace-first-topology]]: namespace-first physical layout.

## Query classes

  into the brain): load [[problem-to-architecture]] and [[system-overview]].

  [[choosing-the-right-primitive]], [[surface-classes]], [[entity-tools]], and

  [[deterministic-workflow-boundary]], [[standing-runtime-failure-posture]],
  [[planning-to-execution-ladder]].

  [[department-model]], `_system/repo-registry-rules.md`, and `repo-registry/README.md`.
- **Repo topology and brain hierarchy** (when does a department or the individual layer

  [[graduate-a-department-to-its-own-brain-repo]], and `_system/repo-registry-rules.md`.

  and the brain-selection index): load [[stand-up-a-multi-brain-parent-workspace]],

## Stable vs stateful

Stable doctrine (durable, changes only on real architectural revision): the control
model, the planning ladder, the surface boundary, the namespace-first topology, the canon
contract, the profile set, retrieval over raw memory, the AI shadow department thesis, the
department assembly model, correction to structure, harness portability, output linkage, the
metric primitive, and public-export posture. These carry `review-on-edit` freshness:
revisit only when an edit touches them or a decision supersedes them. Requirements for
capability the system does not yet run belong in `synthesis/`, never in canon.

Stateful or evolving (needs periodic review): the PM-agent readiness posture (tracks
trial maturity and may change as the agent matures), the Provisional profile schemas
(must be validated against the first real namespace of each type), a namespace gap map
in `synthesis/` (create one as your namespaces upgrade). This namespace has no
live-but-canonical facts, so it carries no `canon/current-truth.md`.

## Open disputes

Contested or unvalidated questions are tracked in `synthesis/`, never in canon:

- Whether any Provisional profile collapses into another (Design System and Component
  Library; or Tool Contract, Data System, and Operating Library).
- Which namespaces still lack the V2 base and in what order they upgrade.
- Whether a future MCP or RAG retriever is planned and how the retrieval policy should
  name it (contract assumption A-01): tracked in `x-research-lessons` alongside the
  retrieval-over-raw-memory lessons.
- Whether the public-starter export, the client-department release, and an internal
  department or individual graduation should collapse into one manifest-driven exporter
  with per-consumer profiles, rather than staying three separately maintained scripts:
  named as the target state in [[reflexive-brain-topology]], not yet built.
- The exact implementation sequence for fleet-level autonomy governance, kill switch,
  identity, accountability, and lifecycle hardening: tracked in
  `autonomy-architecture-gap-register`, with the requirement-level statement and status in
  `autonomy-readiness-requirements`.

## What this namespace drives

This canon should improve:

- the namespace builders and curators (`build-namespace`, `build-knowledge-node`,
  `canonize-a-namespace`, `process-namespace-intake`)
- the deterministic validator rules in `_system/validate.sh` and the profile lint rules
- the swarm launch governance contract and the PM-agent routing model
- the root intake scaffold and its migration plans
- the root session scaffold, session start and closeout discipline, and session-to-memory
  promotion path
- the intake-operations to infinite-brain-ops handoff and PKM-opportunity trail
- the department assembly layer and future head-of-department agents
- the operating scorecard, weekly review cadence, and consolidated issue discipline over the
  whole operation
- fleet-level safety controls: cost caps, concurrency caps, kill switch, identity, and
  receipts
- accountability and cost pacing for recurring agent-owned functions
- the standalone shared platform department pattern, including `devops-platform`
- the reusable department-builder skill, command, and workflow path
- the department-charter requirement and KPI-driven department reporting posture
- the root `tools/` registry and department tool mapping
- the root `secrets/` registry and runtime credential-binding posture
- the root `repo-registry/` and department repo mapping
- the `repo_kind` and `brain_tier` classification and the department-to-repo graduation trigger
- the V2 upgrade plans and audit packets for every other namespace
- the public `llms.txt` export generator, downstream of canon

If a piece of doctrine here drives none of these, question whether it belongs.

## Archive and provenance

This namespace carries no `archive/` (no migrated full-source corpus lives here). Use
`support/` for provenance and migration only. The starter ships it empty; provenance
accumulates as you migrate your own corpus.

Derived thinking does not live in `support/`. It lives in `synthesis/`. Do not put
synthesis in `support/`; do not put migration receipts in `synthesis/`.

## Common misreadings

- Treating canon as a copy of `pillars/`. Canon synthesizes and compresses across the
  graph; it does not paraphrase nodes. If canon and a pillar say the same thing at the
  same length, canon is wrong.
- Looking here for tool, data, design, content, or operating knowledge. This namespace
  holds the architecture for how those namespaces are built, not their content. Route to
  the relevant profile namespace or its `_examples` scaffold.
- Treating departments as a brand-new low-level entity type. Departments are operating
  assemblies over the ontology, not replacements for skills, agents, workflows, or
  namespaces.
- Treating repos as if they are departments, tools, or namespaces. A repo is a container and
  execution boundary; its job, ownership, and migration posture should be explicit in the root
  repo registry.
- Putting open questions in canon. Disputes live in `synthesis/`. Canon states settled
  doctrine.
- Reading the surface boundary as anti-tooling. It is pro-tooling with a contract: many
  adapters are welcome, none may become a second source of truth.
- Assuming intake owns truth. Intake captures and routes; the destination namespace owns
  the durable canon. Intake never owns truth.
- Assuming intake and PKM stewardship are the same department. Intake operations owns
  capture, receipts, and routing suggestions; infinite-brain-ops owns the structural
  decision about what the brain should become.
