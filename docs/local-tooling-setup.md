# Local Tooling Setup (all optional)

The brain works with nothing but this repo and a file-reading coding agent. Everything in
this guide is an optional surface layered on top: install a tool when the work shows a
real need for it, not before. If `/onboard-business` suggested one of these, the
suggestion names the need it saw; if the need is not there yet, skip the tool with zero
loss.

## Obsidian: the reading surface

**What it is for.** Browsing and visualizing the knowledge graph: wikilinks become a
clickable graph, frontmatter becomes filters, and the vault view makes the namespace
structure tangible. Obsidian never owns truth; it reads the same Markdown files your
agent does.

**You want it when** you find yourself wanting to see the graph, browse knowledge
visually, or read and edit notes comfortably outside the terminal.

**You do not need it when** your agent does all the reading and you mostly consume its
answers. Many operators run brains for weeks before opening a vault.

**Setup (5 minutes).**

1. Download Obsidian from `https://obsidian.md` (free for personal use) and install it.
2. Open Obsidian, choose "Open folder as vault," and select this repo's root folder.
3. If the repo ships a `.obsidian/` folder, the vault opens preconfigured (graph view
   colored by `lifecycle_state`, useful defaults). If not, the defaults are fine.
4. Optional: install the community Git plugin inside Obsidian if you want the vault to
   pull and commit on a timer.

## n8n: the deterministic workflow runtime

**What it is for.** Running deterministic workflows: fixed steps, schedules, and
integrations that should execute exactly the same way every time without an AI in the
loop. In this brain, n8n workflow JSON lives in `automations/n8n/`, each export paired with
a companion Markdown node that is the brain's record of what the automation does.

**You want it when** a workflow has fully stabilized: the steps never need judgment, it
should run on a clock or a webhook, and a human or agent re-running it by hand has become
the bottleneck.

**You do not need it when** your recurring loops are young. A workflow run by your agent
from its Markdown definition is the right first stage; promote it to n8n only after the
steps stop changing. Most onboarding-generated workflows should live their first months
as agent-run Markdown.

**Setup (10 to 15 minutes, pick one).**

Docker (recommended for a persistent local service):

```bash
docker volume create n8n_data
docker run -d --name n8n -p 5678:5678 \
  -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \
  docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

Node.js (quick trial, requires a current LTS Node):

```bash
npx n8n
```

Then open `http://localhost:5678`, create the local owner account, and you are running.
Full documentation: `https://docs.n8n.io`. House rules: export every workflow as JSON
into `automations/n8n/`, write the companion `.md` node next to it, and keep credentials
in n8n's own store, never in this repo.

## Paperclip: the runtime cockpit

**What it is for.** The runtime control plane for AI departments: org chart, agents,
issues, heartbeats, budgets, approvals, and audit. The division of labor is strict: the
brain (this repo) stays the planner of record and the home of canon; Paperclip is the
body that runs live task state. Live queue state never lives in git.

**You want it when** you have at least one real department with recurring AI-run work
and the live state (what is in flight, what awaits your approval) has outgrown reading
receipts in the repo.

**You do not need it when** you are pre-department or running one or two workflows. A
fresh brain does not need a cockpit; most adopters should not think about Paperclip in
month one.

**Setup.** Paperclip is a self-hosted service. In local mode its API serves at
`http://localhost:3100/api` and setup runs through the Paperclip CLI. Because
distribution and versions move, follow the Paperclip project's own documentation rather
than this page. If you
do not have access to a Paperclip build, skip this entirely; nothing else in the brain
depends on it.

## The order that usually makes sense

1. No tools: repo plus coding agent (day one, fully functional).
2. Obsidian, once you want to see what you are building.
3. n8n, once a workflow has stabilized enough to deserve determinism.
4. Paperclip, once a department's live state needs a cockpit.
